# Exploring New Features in Modern JavaScript (ES2023+)

JavaScript is constantly evolving, with new features being added regularly to the ECMAScript specification. Staying abreast of these changes can significantly improve your coding practices. Let's look at a couple of notable recent additions.

## `Array.prototype.toSorted()` and similar methods

ES2023 introduced new methods for arrays that return a *new* array with the changes, rather than mutating the original array. This is great for functional programming patterns and working with immutable data structures.

-   `toSorted()`: Returns a new array with the elements sorted.
-   `toReversed()`: Returns a new array with the elements in reversed order.
-   `toSpliced(start, deleteCount, ...items)`: Returns a new array with elements removed and/or replaced, similar to `splice()` but non-mutating.
-   `with(index, value)`: Returns a new array with the element at the given index replaced with the new value.

```javascript
const originalArray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];

const sortedArray = originalArray.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(sortedArray); // [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
console.log(originalArray); // [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] (unchanged)

const replacedArray = originalArray.with(1, 100);
console.log(replacedArray); // [3, 100, 4, 1, 5, 9]
console.log(originalArray); // [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] (unchanged)
```

## `Object.groupBy()` and `Map.groupBy()`

This Stage 3 proposal (likely to be part of a future ECMAScript standard) provides a convenient way to group elements of an iterable (like an array) based on a callback function.

```javascript
const inventory = [
  { name: "asparagus", type: "vegetables", quantity: 5 },
  { name: "bananas", type: "fruit", quantity: 0 },
  { name: "goat", type: "meat", quantity: 23 },
  { name: "cherries", type: "fruit", quantity: 5 },
  { name: "fish", type: "meat", quantity: 22 },
];

// Assuming Object.groupBy is available (e.g., via polyfill or future JS version)
// const result = Object.groupBy(inventory, ({ type }) => type);
/*
result would be:
{
  vegetables: [ { name: "asparagus", type: "vegetables", quantity: 5 } ],
  fruit: [
    { name: "bananas", type: "fruit", quantity: 0 },
    { name: "cherries", type: "fruit", quantity: 5 }
  ],
  meat: [
    { name: "goat", type: "meat", quantity: 23 },
    { name: "fish", type: "meat", quantity: 22 }
  ]
}
*/
```
*Note: `Object.groupBy()` might require a polyfill or a very modern JavaScript environment to work as of late 2024.*

Keeping up with these new features allows developers to write more concise, readable, and efficient JavaScript code.
