# Building Accessible Web Applications: A Practical Guide

Web accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) means designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and they can contribute to the Web.

## Key Principles (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are organized around four main principles, often remembered by the acronym POUR:

1.  **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
    *   Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., `alt` text for images).
    *   Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.
    *   Create content that can be presented in different ways (e.g., simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
    *   Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

2.  **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
    *   Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
    *   Give users enough time to read and use content.
    *   Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
    *   Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

3.  **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
    *   Make text content readable and understandable.
    *   Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
    *   Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

4.  **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
    *   Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Practical Tips

-   **Use Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (`<nav>`, `<button>`, `<article>`, etc.).
-   **ARIA Attributes**: Use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes to enhance semantics where native HTML is insufficient.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Color Contrast**: Check that text and background colors have sufficient contrast.
-   **Forms**: Label all form controls clearly. Provide helpful error messages.
-   **Testing**: Test with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) and automated accessibility checkers.

Building accessible applications is not just a compliance issue; it's about creating a better experience for all users.
