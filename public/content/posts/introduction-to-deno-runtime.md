# An Introduction to Deno

Deno is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. It was created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js, with the aim to fix some of the design issues in Node.js.

## Key Features

1.  **Secure by Default**: Deno executes code in a sandbox. This means scripts have no access to the file system, network, or environment unless explicitly permitted.
    ```bash
    # This script needs explicit permission to access the network
    deno run --allow-net my_server.ts
    ```

2.  **TypeScript Support Out of the Box**: Deno treats TypeScript as a first-class language. You don't need to manually configure a TypeScript compiler; Deno handles it internally.
    ```typescript
    // example.ts
    function greet(name: string): string {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    console.log(greet("World"));
    ```
    You can run this directly with `deno run example.ts`.

3.  **Standard Modules**: Deno provides a set of audited standard modules (e.g., for file system operations, HTTP servers) that are guaranteed to work with Deno. These are hosted at `deno.land/std`.

4.  **Decentralized Packages**: Deno loads modules via URLs, similar to browsers. There's no centralized package manager like npm.
    ```typescript
    import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.200.0/http/server.ts";
    ```

5.  **Built-in Tooling**: Deno comes with a suite of built-in development tools, including a linter (`deno lint`), formatter (`deno fmt`), test runner (`deno test`), and bundler (`deno bundle`).

## Differences from Node.js

-   No `package.json` or `node_modules` folder. Dependencies are managed via URLs.
-   Uses ES modules as the default module system (no `require()`).
-   Explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access.
-   Aims to be more browser-compatible by providing built-in web APIs like `fetch`.

Deno presents an interesting alternative for JavaScript and TypeScript development, particularly for those prioritizing security and modern language features.
